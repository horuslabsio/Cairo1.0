# Control Flow: If-Else and Recursion

In this section, we would be talking about if-else statements and Recursion. Loops are coming Cairo 1.0 but for now we will recursions for repetitive tasks.

## If-else Statements

The concept of conditional statements is general and quite straightforward but in comparison to Cairo 0.x, Cairo 1.0 came with a new option for conditionals: `else if`.

```
let status = true;

if (status == true){
    ...
} else if (status == false){
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```

## Recursions

Recursions were the only option for repetitive tasks in Cairo 0.x but loops are on the way for Cairo 1.0. But, as we wait, let's see how recursions are done in Cairo 1.0.

Let's create a function that sums up the first ten natural numbers using recursion.

```
use array::ArrayTrait;
use option::OptionTrait;

// `start` should be 1_u32 and `sum` be 0_32
fn sum(start: u32, sum: u32) -> Option<u32> {
    match gas::withdraw_gas() {
        Option::Some(_) => {},
        Option::None(_) => {
            let mut data = ArrayTrait::new();
            data.append('Out of gas');
            panic(data);
        },
    }
    // Terminator
    if(start == 11_u32){
        return Option::Some(sum);
    }

    // Sum
    let currentSum = sum + start;
    return sum(start + 1_u32, currentSum);
}
```

- `use array::ArrayTrait;` allows us use arrays
- `use option::OptionTrait;` gives us the `Option` enum which we will talk about in chapter 12.
- From `line 32` to `line 39` is just a boilerplate code we should always add when writing recursive functions in Cairo 1.0
- From `line 42` to `line 44`, we have the terminator that makes sure the function stops at some point.
- `let currentSum = sum + start;` does the increamenting
- And, `return sum(start + 1_u32, currentSum)` calls the function again with the start value plus 1 and the current summation of the values.
